Solves "Letter Matrix" word puzzles

A letter matrix word puzzle is a grid of letters. The task
is to find all words that can be formed by moving from
letter to letter. Only horizontal and vertical movements
are allowed, but in each step, the direction can be freely
chosen.

Takes one or two parameters: The first is the letter matrix
(ascii file), the second is the letter matrix. If the second
parameter is omitted, it defaults to DEFAULT_DICT.
